We bring expert wound & ostomy care to the patient...wherever they are...from hospital to home and everywhere in between. Our experienced, board-certified wound clinicians work with healthcare providers, payers, and patients to provide best in class wound care at a lower cost.

Our board-certified wound & ostomy clinicians use both live video and wound images to evaluate a patient’s wound and consult with the provider to recommend the most effective treatment for better outcomes, improved patient quality of life, and lower overall cost.

Our mobile app allows a patient, a caregiver, or an onsite clinician to easily take wound photos, document the status of the wound and initiate a live video call with Corstrata’s wound experts. Through our cloud-based telehealth platform, our experts monitor the wound’s progress and recommend treatments that promote healing. Corstrata’s HIPAA compliant technologies facilitate documentation which reduces the provider’s legal liability. 

We help healthcare providers become Centers of Excellence for wound care by partnering with the provider for their wound care program. Our services range from comprehensive wound care management to a menu of services to enhance your current program:
         Wound program assessment
         Staff education & annual competencies
         Formulary review & assessment

Here’s what we stand for:
-Governments that answer to citizens – not corporations
-Fair treatment of workers and the right of every human being to make a living, safely and ethically, for themselves and their family;
-The right of ordinary consumers to products that are produced and marketed ethically, sustainably and transparently;
-The right of communities to manage and protect their own environment and natural resources;
-Business models that put people and the planet first instead of being driven by shortsighted greed.

Today's reality is different.

We’ve witnessed again and again what happens when powerful corporations get their way:
-Environmental and health catastrophes;
-A global financial crisis that destroys entire economies;
-Rising food prices and starving children;
-Families globally losing their houses and land;
-Poisons pouring into our air and water.
You name it, corporations are behind it. But rather than being held accountable – their CEOs are often walking away with bonuses. And these injustices are largely left to continue unabated.

But the world doesn’t have to be this way. We own the corporations that are causing all these problems. They rely on us to buy their products. They count on us to buy their stock. They need us to work for them. They need us to continue to elect governments that let them get away with murder.

Our mission is to spread our metabolism-first way of living to a worldwide audience. It’s a flexible lifestyle that helps you get the results that matter: looking your best, feeling your best and doing your best. In the shortest time possible. And in a way that sticks.

We're driving towards becoming a billion-dollar online & offline brand.  We’ve been painstakingly building the products, services, framework and high-performance culture to make this happen. And now we’re ready for a much larger stage.

We’ve built a full ecosystem of products that allow someone to live a metabolism-first lifestyle. This includes exercise and nutrition programs, nutraceuticals, functional foods and membership programs.

So why metabolism-first?  Because something HAS to change.  We’re over-worked, over-stressed and over-fed. And we’re deprived of the sleep, nutrition, exercise, movement and relaxation we need to thrive.  That's a recipe for disaster.

Unfortunately, the typical solution of extreme dieting & exercise trap people into a 1-step-forward-2-steps back vicious cycle that actually makes them worse off. They bounce around from one latest flavor-of-the-month program to the next, never making any progress… staying trapped in a downward spiral.

Rigid philosophies like Paleo or Vegan, while extremely healthy for some, create an us-vs-them tribal mentality that’s self-limiting. Neither of those philosophies work for all people all the time… or even the same person all the time. People differ. People change. If that’s not respected, things will backfire.

That's why we've architected a flexible framework that helps you customize your life so you can reach your fullest metabolic potential.  Instead of fighting against your body or your life, we teach you to work with your body and life to create the perfect program for you.

Dr. Ghannoum's scientific research has resulted in over 400 peer reviewed scientific papers and his publications have been cited over 18,000 times.

After making the breakthrough discovery that bad bacteria and bad fungus work together to create digestive imbalance, Dr. Ghannoum realized that today's probiotics and microbiome tests had not been engineered to specifically address the role fungus plays in digestive health. As a result, he created BIOHM: The first company that addresses the gut's total microbiome of both bacteria and fungus.
