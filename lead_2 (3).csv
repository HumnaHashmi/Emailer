The founding faculty, administrators, and students embraced and embodied this change. They were open and revolutionary in their thinking—more than mere radicals, they dared to imagine a living and learning environment that would foster a community whose passion came from a deep sense of social justice.  

And it shows. 

UC Santa Cruz’s many accomplishments include: 
• The first to map the human genome and make it publicly available—for free, forever 
• Key contributors to the discovery of the Higgs Boson 
• The birthplace of organic farming
• The center of the Dickens Universe
• A graduate gaming program that is one of the top 10 in the country
• Ranked second in the world for its research impact

This university is not to be underestimated.

The campus's unique character is reflected in its students'​ bold choice to elect the fabled Banana Slug as its mascot—with their determined bearing and bright personality, it's hard to ignore Banana Slugs wherever they may roam.

And Banana Slug alumni are everywhere—a network 100,000-plus-strong, comprised of respected scientists, journalists, social activists, political and business leaders, artists, teachers, entrepreneurs, change-makers, and much more. Banana Slugs are changing the world.","ucsc.edu","","Higher Education","https://www.linkedin.com/company/2841","2841","$50M-$100M","5914","5,001-10,000 employees",""

We have a reputation in making an instrumental difference in the most complicated clinical situations. ​Innovative OT consists of a small group of highly skilled therapists. Our area of proficiency is in assisting our client’s and referral sources in successfully accomplishing the following services with an unsurpassed level of knowledge and expertise:
​
Urgent Hospital Discharge Planning
Assessments of Attendant Care Needs – Form 1
Retro-Active Assessments; Rebuttals
Functional In-Home Occupational Therapy Assessments
Work Site/Ergonomic/ Vocational Rehabilitation Services
Home Accessibility Assessments
Completion of Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) Administration of Spinal Cord Injury Measure (SCIM)

Wheelchair Seating Assessments/ Prescription
Individualized Occupational Therapy Intervention Services
Progressive Goal Attainment Programs

Our team presently services the following regions: Niagara Region, Hamilton, Burlington, Oakville, Mississauga, Milton, Brampton, GTA, Guelph, Simcoe and surrounding areas.

​Our areas of clinical practice include acquired brain injury/ neurological impairments, severe orthopedic injury (spinal cord injury/amputation/fractures), psychological disabilities and chronic pain.
​
We provide hospital discharge planning services, followed by community based individualized care planning. There are a multitude of different types of intervention services our team provides including: home/vehicle accessibility, equipment prescription, community safety/reintegration, wheelchair positioning/ seating prescriptions, activities of daily living (ADL) re-training/ functional restoration programming, cognitive remediation/compensatory therapies, cognitive behavioural therapy,  quality of life and return to modified sport programs. Our team is additionally skilled in vocational services, including return to work programs, work-site, vocational exploration and ergonomic assessments.
​
We are seasoned in the completion of various assessments. As occupational therapist's we consider the individual as a whole and assess cognitive function, psychosocial barriers impeding restoration and physical disabilities. This enables our therapist's to develop highly individualized and comprehensive rehabilitation programs. Consideration of whole person impairment enables us to prepare detailed Assessment of Attendant Care Needs- Form 1, Medical-Legal/ Slip-Fall and Future Care Cost reports. 
​
On August 27, 2015 the Ontario Legislature released the changed definition for catastrophic impairment determination which will affect those in accidents on or after June 1, 2016. Our team has proactively adapted our approaches and is skilled in the completion of functional assessments (in-home and community based situational), administering the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE), and Spinal Cord Injury Measure (SCIM). We monitor on every file an individuals daily functioning to ensure that should they present with injuries which may qualify them for a catastrophic designation, this is appropriately pursed.
​
Finally, given the expertise of the team, we are often requested to prepare critiques and rebuttal reports. 

We understand the importance of the role of the occupational therapist in assisting with both functional restoration and file documentation. As a team we are proactive, client centered, creative and take great pride in the services we provide.
